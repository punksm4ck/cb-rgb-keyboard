## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
